There is so much free data out there the idea behind here is to make these resources easily searchable and consumable by state.
They are similar search engines out there but but the all contain resources that are paid or in PDF format etc. 


Data Todos:

* Make list of sites consumable by json
* Go set each search for each data API (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=idaho&sort=views_recent+desc)

Front end Todos:

* Simple CSE search at first
* Search by state, nationwide possible to add other resources later will need to use custom API.
* Exclude any BS formats and websites 
* Give the user a easy way to suggest a site you might be missing
